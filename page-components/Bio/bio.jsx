                    <p>
                        I try everything. I believe in experimenting. You should try it too. That little business idea, try it too. Ranging from me <b>learning baking, to wire works, beads, sewing, selling wigs, running pre-order/ importation, selling snacks</b> in different ranges even trying to become an artist and visiting almost every studio in my area, what confidence, cos my voice is ….. Let’s leave it that way.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Or even in tech I started with <b>desktop publishing and moved to Corel draw</b>. That made me feel like a <b>tech sis in secondary school</b>. To <b>graphics design in photoshop</b>. Then boom I had to choose between illustrations because I loved <b>fashion illustrations</b>. I remember being called out a few times in secondary school for drawing fashion illustrations in secondary school. I was only fair ( not good ) in illustration and that was just fashion/outfit type. I knew the enterprising me will want to try more ventures when I move forward.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I had to choose <b>Website development</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So that I don’t have to pay for branding and website when I want to try any of my ideas. I did website development for a while. Then back to my Graphics design. And the spirit of trial entered again. I started <b>experimenting with Adobe premiere pro</b> with my 1GB ram laptop, later upgraded to 4GB but, you know it finally led to the end of that laptop. So I had to stop for a while. I tried other things during this period outside tech. Like starting a <b>mental health awareness page for teens and young adults</b>. (Askmame).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But I always wanted to go back to something related to tech. Once I got another laptop for a birthday from my dad. I started to learn or let’s say continue to learn my video editing. I did that for almost 4 months and I didn’t make the kind of progress I wanted for the amount of time I was putting into it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Used a month to pick another skill, <b>3D design on Adobe Dimension</b>. At this point, I just wanted to go back to my website development. I learned that you use UI designs and code them. Joined the <b>GDSC club for UNILAG for UI/UX</b>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the first week, I just said this is it. Like this will allow me to create product solutions for even other people’s ideas.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rest is history, maybe.
